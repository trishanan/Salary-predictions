# Salary Prediction Project(Python)
The purpose of this project is to use data transformation and machine learning to create a model that will predict a salary when given years of experience, job type, college degree, college major, industry, and miles from a metropolis.

Methodology
Data Wrangling - Removed duplicates and dropped misssing or null values in the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis - Analyzed the data and summarized the main characteristics.
Data Visualization - Used boxplot, distribution plot, scatter plot, violin plot, residual plot and regression plot to visualize the data and it's characteristics.
Machine Learning Algorithms Used - Linear Regression, Polynomial Transformation, Ridge Regression and Random Forest
Evaluation Metrics Used - Mean Squared Error(MSE) and R-squared
Technologies/Libraries Used
 - Python 3
 - Jupyter
 - Pandas
 - Numpy
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - Scikit-Learn
 - Scipy
Datasets available
The data for this model is fairly simplified as it has very few missing areas. The raw data consists of a training dataset with the features - jobType, degree, major, industry, yearsExperience and milesFromMetropolis and their corresponding salaries. Twenty percent of this training dataset was split into a test dataset with corresponding salaries.

There is also a testing dataset that does not have any salary information available and was used as a substitute for real-world data and used the model to predict it's values/salaries.

Information Used to Predict Salaries
Years Experience: How many years of experience
Job Type: The position held (CEO, CFO, CTO, Vice President, Manager, Janitor, and senior or junior position)
College Degree: Doctoral, Masters, Bachelors, High School, or None
College Major: Biology, Business, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Literature, Math, Physics, or None
Industry: Auto, Education, Finance, Health, Oil, Service, or Web
Miles From Metropolis: How many miles away from a major city
Summary
Applying second order polynomial transformation to the features led to the most accurate predictions with the least error when using a linear regression model. The result was a mean squared error of 354 with a 76% accuracy rate.
This model can be used as a guide when determining salaries since it leads to reasonable predictions when given information on years of experience, miles from metropolis, job type, industry, and college degree and major.
